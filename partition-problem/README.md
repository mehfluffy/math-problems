# Partition problem: a genetic algorithm
This is a small project to solve the partition problem via a genetic algorithm.

The partition problem is the task of finding out whether a set of positive integers can be put into two subsets,
such that the sums of the two subsets are equal.

In this programme, the routine exits when a solution with equal sums is found, or when the number of generations runs out.
The integers are defined by the user, but is limited to 20 integers in the closed interval [1, `RAND_MAX`].
